# ðŸ˜‚ Meme Generator

One of my first ever web dev projects - a simple app where **you upload your own image**, type your meme text, and boom: instant meme.

Everything is packed into **one big HTML file** with inline JavaScript and CSS.  
No libraries. No frameworks. No AI.

## Why I Made This?
- I built this while learning:
    - How file uploads and text inputs work
    - How to place and style text over image
    - Basic web dev stuff
